Machine Learning Term Project -- Classify Mushrooms as Edible or Poisonous 

This project uses Gradient Descent to produce weights for different mushroom cap characteristics based on the data set:

After running the gradient descent on an 80/20 split the test data shows 94% accuracy:

The program then asks the user to enter mushroom characteristics and using the trained model returns a prediction of whether that mushroom is edible or poisonous.
